## Project Name
IBOURIT

## Idea & Scope
### Background
People these days like to show off their possessions. We can observe this trend easily on any popular SNS like Instagram or Facebook. But by nature, showing off (or bragging) is not welcomed by people, and even those who love to brag tend to feel a bit of guilt or shame by doing it.

But sneak peek is also a natural instinct of mankind, so why don’t we have some good place where anyone is allowed to show off one’s stuff legitimately?

IBOURIT is here
IBOURIT is a simple social network service specifically for those who love to brag.

Users would love to take a picture of something they just bought, and share it on IBOURIT.

There are a bunch of cool features to help them brag about what they just got.

Also, users can sneak peek other’s inventory however they want, so to know how’s owning what.
